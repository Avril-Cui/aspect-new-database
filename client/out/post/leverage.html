However, there is another way to ‚Äúleverage‚Äù your returns. With the $100 you have, you can borrow an additional $50 from the bank. Now, if you invest the $150 in the stock market, instead of $110, you now have a net asset of $165 (which is 55 dollars more, even if you pay the $50 dollars back, you still earn $5 more)!
