If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.” He also commended Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory’s efficiency. Many employees had lived and worked in the factory during Shanghai’s lockdown to keep the production line going.

Most salaried employees are paid for 40 hours of work per week, but hours over or less this amount will not cause changes in the fixed salary. A benefit of salaried employees is that since the salary is pre-determined, the company does not need to pay more to workers who work more than 40 hours. However, if workers are frequently late to jobs or do not work enough hours per week, hiring salaried employees can be a loss for the company.</p><h2 class="article_h2__aXR8r">Hourly Employee</h2><p>An hourly employee receives a salary based on a specific rate per hour of working. Hourly employees will also receive an additional paid rate for working time exceeding 40 hours. Although companies are required to pay more to their employees (if employees work more than 40 hours), hiring hourly employees can be benefitial since companies can eliminate unnecessary expenses paid to unqualified workers (workers not reaching the required work time).</p><h1 class="article_h1__RsK1M">Analysis On The Job Cut</h1><p>After understanding the advantages and deficiencies behind salaried employees and hourly employees, we can find some clues behind Tesla’s job cut. In Musk’s letter, he keeps emphasizing “working efficiency” and his disappointments for employees not coming to the job or being late. Therefore, cutting salaried workers and switching to hourly employees can be a solution for Tesla to eliminate the above situations. Besides, since hourly employees will receive more payment if they work more than 40 hours, accepting more hourly employees could potentially be a way that Tesla used to encourage its workers to work longer and harder.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/n6repj5a/production/b2d2a8dfc5d4eaae4197b586cd4e5092c1536ac9-1024x536.png"/></figure><p><em>Image source: <a href="https://god-dd.imgix.net/2022/06/elon-musk-remote-work-.jpg?fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=536&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large" class="article_link___hBK0">https://god-dd.imgix.net/2022/06/elon-musk-remote-work-.jpg?fit=scale&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=536&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large</a>.</em></p></div></div></article></div><hr class="max-w-lg my-5 mx-auto border border-green-500"/><form class="flex flex-col p-5 max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-10"><h3 class="article_form_question__9nvaE">Is this article helpful for you?</h3><h4 class="text-3xl font-bold">Leave a comment below!</h4><hr class="py-3 mt-2"/><div><p class="article_login_sign__vY1wZ">Log in to leave a comment.</p></div></form><div class="article_center__uudcR"><p class="article_comment_header__ZxWCJ">Comments</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"_createdAt":"2022-06-30T18:12:04Z","_id":"376fca1d-b0e0-4826-abf5-a440c76d030b","author":{"image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-59b618a84f64169b0adc1104a2671e6860801d39-538x532-png","_type":"reference"}},"name":"Friday the “Bullish Queen”"},"body":[{"_key":"587dd97e0644","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"2728565875f90","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"What Happened To Tesla?"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"h1"},{"_key":"68c2988cf7b0","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"0b01940538070","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Tesla, the car manufacturer giant, has over 110,000 employees around the globe.
