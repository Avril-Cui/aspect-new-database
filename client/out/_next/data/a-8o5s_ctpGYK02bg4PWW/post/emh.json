For years, scholars, financial experts, and the entire Wall Street worked hard in seeking methods that can result in higher alpha. Alpha simply stands for the additional return for a portfolio compared to the benchmark‚Äôs return rate. Surprisingly, the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) suggests that all of these methods are invalid and that it is nearly impossible to generate alpha if an investor purely relies on stock selection and purchase timing. The EMH is undoubtedly a critical theory in finance, as it proposed the relationship between risk and return.
