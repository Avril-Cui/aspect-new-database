Through various valuation methods, investors are capable of forecasting the future value of a company. But instead of future value, investors are more interested in its ‚Äúreal‚Äù current value, AKA the intrinsic value, because it provides information to show whether a deal is worth it (such as purchasing a stock). Comparison between the intrinsic value and the market value helps determine whether the company is overvalued or undervalued by the market. To do so, we need to form a calculation that can ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù the forecasted future value back into the current value, and there comes the discount rate."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"8355c8b2bd35","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"70352cf2157a0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"The discount rate is based on the "},{"_key":"70352cf2157a1","_type":"span","marks":["df69771bb9af"],"text":"Time Value of Money (TVM)"},{"_key":"70352cf2157a2","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":" theorem, which states that money today is worth more than money in the future.
