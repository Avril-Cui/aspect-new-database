-> reduce model size by decreasing data points


Start server and store this in ram:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6,4,1,3]


if you know when the server started -> t0

and you know when you're getting a request, tx

you can always find out where you're at by doing tx-t0= position in the array;



Stage 1->

Http endpoint: get price -> Long getBaseprice(Company A, PoT t, FIXED Random seed, long tx){
 
 Map<String, List<long>> companyhistory;
}


Stage 2 ->

2 functions:

Long user interaction(Price p, ModelOfUserInteractionThatItIsCurrentlyUndefinedAvrilNoDisrespectDanielPleaseIdontKnowEverything);

Long getBaseprice(Company A, PoT t, FIXED Random seed, long tx);

Http endpoint -> getBaseprice(A, t, seed, tx) +  interaction(p, respect);

GENERATING List<LONG> is very expensive
