Sequence:
1. Historical price contains all price data used in this model.
   Wakron (WRKN) is one of my virtual companies and is used as a sample 
   to demonstrate this model.
2. save_parameters.py contains the code to request historical data.
3. get_parameters.py calculates the required parameters for Stochastic
   differential equations (macro model) and Death & Birth process (micro model).
4. simulator_simplified_version.py contains an easier version of the model. 
   It does not include the micro model.
5. stock_simulator.py is the main script. Please read this file when reading
   through the whole model.
6. aspect_simulator.py is an old version of my model. I keep it in this folder
   for future references.
